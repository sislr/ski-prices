# Secrets defined here are available for reference under registry/password, env/secret, builder/secrets,
# and accessories/*/env/secret in config/deploy.yml. All secrets should be pulled from either
# password manager, ENV, or a file. DO NOT ENTER RAW CREDENTIALS HERE! This file needs to be safe for git.

# Example of extracting secrets from Rails credentials
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(rails credentials:fetch kamal.registry_password)

# Use a GITHUB_TOKEN if private repositories are needed for the image
# GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh config get -h github.com oauth_token)

# Improve security by using a password manager. Never check config/master.key into git!
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
